# Nutri-Recommender-Personalized-Food-Recommendation-System-

An AI-powered food recommendation platform that transforms large-scale food and nutrition datasets into personalized meal and item recommendations using hybrid machine learning techniques. The system combines collaborative filtering, content-based modeling, semantic embeddings, and clustering to improve recommendation accuracy and preference matching.

This project integrates recommendation systems, dimensionality reduction, NLP embeddings, similarity modeling, and performance optimization techniques to build a scalable nutrition intelligence engine.

🎯 Problem Statement

Users searching for food or diet recommendations often face:
	•	too many food options with little personalization
	•	weak matching between preferences and suggestions
	•	keyword-based matching that ignores semantics
	•	sparse user-item interactions
	•	high-dimensional nutrition features
	•	inefficient similarity scoring

Basic recommenders answer “what is popular?” —
but not “what is right for this user?”

This system focuses on answering:

Which food items best match a user’s preferences and nutritional patterns?
